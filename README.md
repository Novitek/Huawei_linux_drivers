# Huawei_linux_drivers

This are the drivers which worked for my Huawei USB modem.

Hope this is useful for you too.

I am provinding two of them.

Installing procedures:

make sure you have :
-make
-gcc
-g++
-build-essentials

in your system.

Step 1:
Choose one of the folder i.e A or B.

Step 2:
open the sub directory i.e Linux

Step 3:
Open terminal and type 
 sudo ./install
 
  This will install the driver modules to your system.
  
Step 4:
Reboot your system,so that the new modules are loaded.
